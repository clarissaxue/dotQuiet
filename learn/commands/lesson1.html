  <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
    
    
    <h3>pwd</h3>
    <p>
        The Linux terminal begins at the root directory, denoted with a slash (/), and works its way down to subdirectories.
        Try typing "pwd" (print working directory) in the terminal to see which directory you're in!
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing correct answer):
        /dotQuiet/lesson1/
    </p>
    
    <h3>ls</h3>
    <p>
        While keeping track of what directory we're in is important, we need to know where we are going and what we can do in the current directory.
        Try typing "ls" into the terminal to <strong>list</strong> the contents of the current directory!
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing correct answer):
        dir1 dir2 dir3 welcome.txt
        
        Additional comments (that display off the terminal in the lesson section):
        The current directory has three directories (in "color1") and a text file "welcome.txt" (in "color2")
    </p>
    
     <h3>cd</h3>
    <p>
        Let's see what's in those directories, try typing "cd" (change directory) followed by a space and the name of the directory you want to change to (ex: cd dir1) (Tip: two dots (..) represents the directory above the one you're in, one dot (.) represents the directory you're currently in).
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing correct answer):
        (nothing)  
    </p>
    
    <h3>cd pt. 2 (may not need its own header)</h3>
    
    <p>
        Don't worry, you did it right.  Sometimes the terminal displays nothing, this usually indicates that something happened behind the scenes, the terminal  will warn you when something isn't right.
        
        Type "pwd" again to see that you changed to the right directory.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Terminal result:
        /dotQuiet/lesson1/(dir entered from before)/
    </p>
    
    <h3>mkdir</h3>
    <p>
        Looking good! You're well on your way to Linux mastery! Try making your own directory by typing "mkdir" followed by a space and the name of your new directory (tip: directory and file names with spaces must be separated by backslashes or wrapped in quotes.  Ex: birds\ of\ the\ world, "the island of hawaii.pdf").
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing correct answer):
    </p>
    
    <h3>mkdir pt. 2 (may not need its own label)</h3>
    
    <p>
        Type "ls" to see the new directory you made!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing the correct answer):
        (name of the new directory the user made) (other directories or files included in the directory they changed to)
    </p>
    
    <h3>rmdir</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes its necessary to remove a directory.  Try removing one of the directories in the current directory using "rmdir" followed by a space and the directory name.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing correct answer):
        (none)
    </p>
    
    <h3>rmdir pt. 2 (may not need its own label)</h3>
    
    <p>
        Type "ls" to see the current directory's contents, the directory you listed in your input should be gone!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing the correct answer):
        (name of the new directory the user made) (other directories or files included in the directory they changed to, minus the one they removed)
    </p>
    
    <h3>clear</h3>
    <p>
        Working in the terminal produces a lot of text feedback, type "clear" at any time to remove all command history.  Any changes you made to the file structure will stay, this command is simply used to start fresh.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing correct answer):
        (session restart)
    </p>
    
    <h3>man</h3>
    
    <p>
       If you ever find yourself lost while using the terminal, you can always look to the <strong>manual.</strong> Try typing "man" to see a list of commands and their uses. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing the correct answer):
        (manual)
    </p>
