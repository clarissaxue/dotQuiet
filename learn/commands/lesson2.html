    <h3>touch</h3>
    <p>
        So far we've covered how to move through, make, and remove directories, but we have no way of populating those directories with files.  This is where "touch" comes in, creating a file with the name listed after the command.  Try creating a file using the terminal (Tip: use an extension like ".txt" on the end of your file's name so other programs can open it).
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Terminal Result (displayed after typing correct answer, will automatically "use ls"):
        letters 'song lyrics' books (name of the file created by "touch")
        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Additional comments:
        See your file with the directories from before?  Pretty neat, right?
    </p>
    
    <h3>rm</h3>
    <p>
        Your computer could get pretty cluttered if there were no way to remove files, try removing the file you just created with "rm".

        Additional comments:
        See ya!  Your file is no more, good thing we didn't add anything important to it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>mv</h3>
    
    <p>
        Moving files to their appropriate folders is equally important to making them, change to the directory 'books' and move the file 'The Shining.pdf' to the directory above.  (hint: recall that ".." represents the directory )
        
        <br>(for backend programmers: this requires the user to use "cd books" and "mv 'The Shining.pdf' ..")
    </p>

        Terminal Result of changing directories (displayed after typing correct answer, will automatically "use ls"):
        'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.pdf' 'The Hobbit.pdf' 'The Shining.pdf'<br>
        
        Terminal Result of moving 'The Shining.pdf', will automatically "use ls":
        'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.pdf' 'The Hobbit.pdf'
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Additional comments:
        As you can see, the pdf you moved is no longer there, change directories with ".." to confirm that the file moved.

    <h3>mv pt. 2</h3>
    
    <p>
        Renaming files with the terminal also uses mv, as long as there is no conflict between file names and directories are not confused for files.  Move to the "letters" directory and change the name of 'Recommendation Letter.txt' to 'Final Recommendation Letter.txt' (Hint: mv (current file name) (new file name)).
