        <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
        level 3:
        locate
        ssh
        (more to be decided on)
        
        <h3>locate</h3>
        
        <p>
            The examples provided up to this point have used relatively uncrowded file systems, in reality, your operating system will become crowded very quickly with programs, media, and other files.  One rememdy to this problem is the "locate" command, which displays all files that satisfy your criteria and their locations.  Use "locate" and your knowledge of wildcards to display all files that end in '.txt'.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            (Will display directory contents on entry to page)<br>
            contents: TBD
            
            
            commands required: <br>
            locate "*.txt" <br>
            
            Terminal:
            (displays all textfiles in system)
            
            Additional comments:
            Adding the option "-n" followed by a number to your "locate" call will display until your number is reached. 
        </p>
        
        
       <h3>ssh</h3>
        
        <p>
            Collaborative system are an essental part of nearly all computing environments today.  Servers can be accessed through the "ssh" (Secure Shell) command, allowing users to interact with files on another system (in this case, a server).  Access our server with the command "ssh dotQuiet.org" and find the location of the file "lesson3.txt".
        </p>
        
        <p>
            commands required:
            ssh dotQuiet.org<br>
            
            Additional comment (displays on the text field apart from the terminal):<br>
            The text before the cursor now displays what server you're connected to, in this case, dotQuiet.org.
            
            locate "lesson3.txt"<br>
