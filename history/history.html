    <h2>Beginnings</h2>

    <p>
        Linux began as a personal project by computer science student Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki.  Having grown used to the superior functionality of the university's Unix systems, Torvalds desired to acquire a Unix operating system for personal use, unfortunately, such systems were proprietary and could only be purchased at high prices.  This dilemma drove Torvalds to spearhead the Linux project, a free and open-source Unix-like operating system
    </p>

    <h2>Unix Roots</h2>

    <p>
        Simply put, Unix or Unix-like systems are operating systems that accomplish some complex task through the collaboration of highly specialized modules.  Originally developed at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, this form of hardware and software architecture and engineering philosophy is responsible for the structure of Linux in its earliest and most recent forms.

    <h2>Open Source Nature and Pervasive Distributions</h2>

    <p>
        Due to its open source nature, Linux has been downloaded, modified, and redistributed thousands (if not millions) of times to machines across the globe.  Linus Torvalds, Linux's original developer continues to update the original Linux source code or "kernel" to this day, merging the work of thousands of other developers with his own.  Linux has even surpassed its original obstacle of being too esoteric and intimidating for the average user through distributions with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  Several of these modern distributions (listed below) approach usability levels that rival the software of Apple and Microsoft with none of the associated costs.
